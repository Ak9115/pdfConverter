# DOCX to PDF Converter

This is a React-based web application that allows users to upload a `.docx` file and convert it to a PDF format using an external API. The app provides a simple interface for users to upload their files, convert them, and then download the resulting PDF.

## Features

- **File Upload**: Users can upload a `.docx` file for conversion.
- **Conversion Process**: The DOCX file is sent to an API for conversion to PDF.
- **Downloadable PDF**: After successful conversion, users can download the resulting PDF.
- **Loading & Error Handling**: The app displays a loading state during conversion and shows error messages if something goes wrong.

## Demo

You can see the live demo of the app here (if available).

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Frontend framework for building the user interface.
- **Axios**: For making HTTP requests to the conversion API.
- **React Hooks**: Using `useState` and `useEffect` for state management and side-effects.
- **FormData API**: Used to handle file uploads in the browser.
- **External API**: Converts DOCX to PDF format.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project locally, ensure that you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v12 or higher)
- npm (Node Package Manager) or Yarn (Alternative package manager)

## Setup

To get started with this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/docx-to-pdf-converter.git
   cd docx-to-pdf-converter
Install the dependencies using npm or yarn:

If you're using npm:

bash
Copy code
npm install
If you're using yarn:

bash
Copy code
yarn install
Create a .env file in the root directory and add your API key like this:

env
Copy code
REACT_APP_API_KEY=your-api-key
Start the development server:

If you're using npm:

bash
Copy code
npm start
If you're using yarn:

bash
Copy code
yarn start
The app will be available at http://localhost:3000.

How It Works
File Upload: The user uploads a .docx file by clicking the file input button.
File Conversion: Once the file is uploaded, it is sent to an external API (pdfrest.com in this case) for conversion to PDF.
Download Link: After the conversion, the user is provided with a download link to the resulting PDF.
API Configuration
The app uses the pdfrest.com API for converting DOCX to PDF. You can replace the API endpoint and API key in the handleConvert function (inside App.js) with your own API details.

To do this, update the following code in App.js:

javascript
Copy code
const config = {
  method: 'post',
  maxBodyLength: Infinity,
  url: 'https://api.pdfrest.com/pdf', // Replace with your API endpoint
  headers: {
    'Api-Key': 'your-api-key', // Replace with your actual API key
    ...formData.getHeaders?.() || {},
  },
  data: formData,
};
Error Handling
If the user doesn't select a file, the app will show an error message: "Please select a file to convert."
If there's an issue with the conversion API, an error message is displayed: "Failed to convert document."
Possible Improvements
Implement drag-and-drop functionality for file uploads.
Add a progress bar to indicate the conversion status.
Support more file formats (e.g., .doc, .txt).
Handle different file validation checks (e.g., file size, supported file types).

### Key Points:
- **Replace `your-username`** in the `git clone` command with your actual GitHub username.
- **Replace `your-api-key`** in the `.env` file with your actual API key.
- **API Endpoint**: If you're using a different conversion API, replace the `url` field with the correct endpoint.
